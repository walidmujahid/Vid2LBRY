"""Base class that provides an interface to make requests to the LBRY APIs.

The basic functionality is making a POST request to a given URL (server),
with a given method (API function), and the parameters which that method
needs (params).

We want to be able to continuously make requests if we need to,
so this is implemented as a class that is initialized once, and then
it can make multiple requests to the API.
